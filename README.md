This project was developed as part of a group effort for http://lifesciencescourse.org/vstup-do-r-ta-rnk-sekvenuvannya course. The original version is available at [here](https://github.com/sviatkh/spatial-transcriptomics-project). I contributed to cell type annotation part.

Aim of this project is to analyse the data from "Microglial INPP5D limits plaque formation and glial reactivity in the PSAPP mouse model of Alzheimerâ€™s disease" paper.
